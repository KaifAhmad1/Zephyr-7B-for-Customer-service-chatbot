# Zephyr-7B-for-Customer-service-chatbotOverview
Objective: This repository guides the fine-tuning of the Zephyr-7B-α language model for creating a customer support chatbot.

Model Type: Zephyr-7B-α is a 7B-parameter GPT-like model, optimized for English language processing through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Key Tools and Libraries:

LLM: Zephyr 7B Alpha (Language Model)
TRL Library: Transformer language model training with reinforcement learning support.
PeFT Library: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models.
Accelerate: Simplified training and scaling for various distributed configurations.
BitsAndBytes: Lightweight CUDA custom functions wrapper, including 8-bit optimizers and quantization.
AutoGPTQ: User-friendly LLM quantization package (GPTQ algorithm).
Optimum: Transformers extension for efficient training and deployment on specific hardware configurations.
Installation: Set up the environment and install necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
! pip install -qU \
       transformers \
       datasets \
       trl \
       peft \
       accelerate \
       bitsandbytes \
       auto-gptq \
       optimum
Model Configuration: Configure the model by specifying model ID, dataset ID, and defining essential fields.

Dataset Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset, adding context to the instruction and target for each sample.

Tokenizer and Model Preparation: Load the tokenizer and prepare the model for fine-tuning, including quantization and LoRa module integration where required.

Training Loop Configuration: Define training loop parameters such as batch size, optimizer, learning rate, and logging intervals.

Model Training and Deployment: Fine-tune the model and deploy it to the Hugging Face Hub for accessibility by other users.

Inference with Fine-Tuned Model: An example demonstrates the use of the fine-tuned model for inference, covering tokenization, model output generation, and inference time measurement.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up and fine-tuning a language model to create a customer support chatbot using Zephyr-7B-α and a suite of libraries and tools.
