This repository guides the fine-tuning of the Zephyr-7B-α language model for a customer support chatbot. The model, optimized for English with 7B parameters, uses DPO. Key tools include TRL, PeFT, Accelerate, BitsAndBytes, AutoGPTQ, and Optimum. Installation involves dependencies like transformers and datasets.

Configuration includes model and dataset IDs. Preprocessing adds context to samples, and preparation involves loading the tokenizer and configuring the model for fine-tuning, including quantization and LoRa module integration. The training loop is set with parameters like batch size and optimizer.

The repository covers model training, deployment on Hugging Face Hub, and inference examples. It serves as a guide for creating a customer support chatbot using Zephyr-7B-α, with detailed instructions in the repository.
