# Zephyr-7B-for-Customer-service-chatbotOverview
This repository focuses on the fine-tuning process for creating a customer support chatbot using the Zephyr-7B-α language model, tailored to excel in English language processing via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Below are the key libraries and tools employed in this project:

LLM: Zephyr 7B Alpha: A state-of-the-art language model.
TRL Library: A comprehensive toolbox for training transformer language models with reinforcement learning support.
PeFT Library: A mechanism for efficiently adapting pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks.
Accelerate: A tool simplifying training and inference scaling, compatible with diverse distributed configurations.
BitsAndBytes: A lightweight wrapper for CUDA custom functions, encompassing 8-bit optimizers and quantization functions.
AutoGPTQ: A user-friendly LLM quantization package based on the GPTQ algorithm.
Optimum: An extension of Transformers, offering optimization tools for efficient training and deployment on tailored hardware setups.

Model Configuration
Configure the model by specifying the model ID, dataset ID, and defining context, instruction, target fields, and other critical model settings.

Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
Load and preprocess the dataset for fine-tuning. The preprocessing step involves the addition of context to the instruction and target for each dataset sample.

Tokenizer and Model Preparation
Load the tokenizer and prepare the model for fine-tuning. Configure model parameters, such as quantization and LoRa module integration, where necessary.

Training Loop Configuration
Configure the training loop by defining crucial parameters, including batch size, optimizer, learning rate, logging intervals, and more, using the TrainingArguments class.

Model Training and Deployment
Fine-tune the model and deploy it to the Hugging Face Hub for accessibility by other users.

Inference with Fine-Tuned Model
This section outlines an example of utilizing the fine-tuned model for inference. It covers the tokenization process, model output generation, and measures the inference time.

This repository serves as an in-depth guide for setting up and fine-tuning a language model to create a customer support chatbot using the Zephyr-7B-α model and a suite of libraries and tools.
